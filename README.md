# Project Background 

In times of economic instability, the process of investing in stocks through technical analysis becomes a volatile task. As such, examining a companyâ€™s intrinsic value through fundamental analysis of comprehensive financial documents becomes a more reliable investing strategy. Despite this improved investing approach, fundamental analysis remains a difficult task to implement due to the complexity and unstructured nature of financial documents such the 10-K. In this project we addressed the issues associated with fundamental investing through a comprehensive machine learning pipeline. This provides a supportive system to help inform investors of a company's financial health when deciding whether or not to invest in a company.

In this project, we examine Udit Gupta's research project GPT-InvestAR: Enhancing Stock Investment Strategies Through Annual Report Analysis with Large Language Models. With some brief modifications, we aim to reduce the computational and time complexity of the author's work while maintaining similar investing results. These brief modifications are detailed in our final written report and published in this repository.
